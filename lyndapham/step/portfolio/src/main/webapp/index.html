            <h1>Recent Projects</h1>
            <p>Spring Quarter 2020: I was elected as UW ACM-W's PR Officer! I am so excited to provide students in computer science with opportunities
                to network with our industry affliates and to learn about different careers in technology.</p>
            <p>Spring Quarter 2020: I was involved in <a href="https://www.mealmatchup.org/">Meal Matchup</a>, a project designed by a UW student
                and lecturer team.</p>
            <p>Winter Quarter 2020: I was the props master and dramaturg for Vietgone, a musical put on by <a href="https://uwuts.org/">Undergraduate
                Theater Society</a>, a theater club at UW. I also took a drama class this quarter. These experiences strengthened my resolve to minor in drama!</p>
            <p>2018-2019: I was on a design team for <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/adaptuw/">HuskyADAPT</a>, a club at UW that looks to partner
                with community members to design solutions for various issues in accessibility. I also attended a toy adaptation and soldered for the first time.</p>
            <p> I also love to write (but I don't have the chance to write as much as I like to). I often joke that it was chance that I pursued computer
                science instead of an English degree. <a href="essays.html">Check out some of my favorite essays!</a></p>
