            Hi. I am Leonardo and I currently go to the University of
            Washington in Bothell. I was born and raised in the state of
            Washington. I am mostly self-taught in JavaScript and Python.
          </p>
          <h2>Interests</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>I enjoy programming and listening to music.</li>
              <li>I like spending time with my cat.</li>
              <li>I am learning the art of photo editing</li>
            </ul>
          <h2>Why programming?</h2>
          <p>
            Growing up, I did not know what I wanted to do as a career. I 
            loved art. I loved drawing and creating small comics. However, due
            to personal reasons, I had to find something else as a potential
            career.
          </p>
          <p>
            Around the age 17, I still did not know what I wanted to do. One
            day, I got bored and asked a friend if he could help me build a
            small interactable chat bot. For the next few months, I spent hours
            debugging, and writing code. I had no idea what I was doing.
            Everything was new to me, but with a lot of googling and try
            catching errors, I had completed my first independent project. The
            code is very unreadable. I have tried to go back and decode it, but
            I have had no luck. I still have the code stored somewhere on
            GitLab.
