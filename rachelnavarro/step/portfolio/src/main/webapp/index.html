	<p>Hi there, and welcome to my portfolio!</p>
	<p>I'm Rachel(she/her/hers), a current STEP intern here at Google. I'm 
	   also a rising junior at UC Irvine(zot zot zot!), where I am majoring in Computer Science with a specialization 
	   in Intelligent Systems. When I'm not coding, you can probably find me:
        </p>
      	<ul>
	      	<li>Practicing yoga. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shavasana">Shavasana, or "corpse pose,"</a> is my favorite!) </li>
	      	<li>Consuming an ungodly amount of caffienated drinks. </li>
	      	<li>Attempting to skateboard. (And eating the pavement every. single. time.) </li>
	      	<li>Watching Tarantino films. </li>
	      	<li>Trying my hand at baking. (Still searching for the perfect vegan chocolate chip cookie recipe!) </li>
	      	<li>Scrolling endlessly through Tik Tok. (lol) </li>
      	</ul>

      <br>
      <p> I've always had an affinity for utilizing my creativity to build new things. I'm very curious about technology and the ways in 
         which it can be used to fix, connect, and ultimately improve our world. I am also passionate about using tech as a way to give voice
	 to marginalized communities, and I can't wait to someday create tools that can be used to help drive positive societal change.
